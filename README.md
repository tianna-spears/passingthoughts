This is a project from the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path (Unit 4/5).

The purpose of building this application is to sharpen skills in React. In this project, we’ll build a place for our passing thoughts. Once you add a short thought, it’ll disappear after just 15 seconds. 

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
